			<h1>Word length statistics in English</h1>
			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>This article is about statistics of word length in English. It answers about the mean length of words in English, and correlation with the popularity of it. Also, I wrote about how did I write technical side of this article.</p>
			<h2>Statistics</h2>
			<p>On this chart, you can see the count of words, with a different length. Here are using 20k most popular words and 10k most popular words datasets. Using 10k dataset, most popular (and mean) word length is 6 symbols. As we can see the difference between datasets, further is the word length from 6 symbols (longer), than it is less popular.</p>

				<canvas id="myChart">Fuck you, not a chart.</canvas>
			</div>
			<h2>How did I make it</h2>
			<p>I use Chart.js here because this is the only chart library which I know. To count words length I used Node.js script because insert an analysis of the dictionary into the page would be overhead. This script is <a href="readdata.js">here</a>.</p>
			<h2>What did I use</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.chartjs.org">Chart.JS</a> &mdash; Charts.</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english">google-10000-english</a> &mdash; Most popular English words.</li>
